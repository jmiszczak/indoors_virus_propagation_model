\caption{Mean increase in the number of infected agents for different values of mobility parameter $\mu$. Each plot represents the absolute increase of the number of infected agents in the population of 100 agents with different number of initially infected agents, ranging from $1$ to $10$,  and with different values of probability contaminating the items.}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\includegraphics{plots/sick_increase_large_s_pop50.pdf}
\caption{Mean increase in the number of infected agents for different values of mobility parameter $\mu$ for the population of 50 agents. Other parameters are described in caption of Fig.~\ref{fig:sick_increase_large_s_pop100} and the colour scale is the same. One should note that even for the significant portion of the infected agents in the population, the spread of the disease is limited.}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\includegraphics{plots/sick_increase_small_s_pop100_world-3.pdf}
\caption{Mean increase in the number of infected agents for different values of mobility parameter $\mu$ with the contamination parameters for the population without coughing agents. The population of agents was set to 100 and configuration of obstacles from Fig~\ref{fig:gui-world-3}. The colour scale is the same as in the Figs~\ref{fig:sick_increase_large_s_pop100} and \ref{fig:sick_increase_large_s_pop50}. One should note that even for the significant portion of the infected agents in the population, the spread of the disease is limited.}
