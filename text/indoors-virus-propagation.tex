\caption{Mean increase in the number of infected agents for different values of mobility parameter $\mu$. Each plot represents the absolute increase of the number of infected agents in the population of 100 agents with different number of initially infected agents, ranging from $1$ to $10$,  and with different values of probability contaminating the items. The results were obtained by running \texttt{exp6} from \texttt{experiments-v2.xml}.}
